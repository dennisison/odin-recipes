    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 stick butter, melted</li>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 unbaked 9″ (deep dish) pie shell or 2 unbaked 9″ (shallow) pie shells*</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees.</li>
        <li>Place the butter and sugar in the mixing bowl of a stand mixer, or use a hand mixer. Mix together on medium speed for a couple of minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the whipping cream and mix on high speed for about two minutes until the cream has started to slightly thicken and the mixture is light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add the beaten eggs, vanilla and flour and mix well.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into unbaked pie shell'(s) and cover the edges of the crust with foil.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 45 minutes until the top is golden brown and no longer jiggly in the center.</li>
        <li>Cool completely before serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <p>*The original recipes states to use a 9″ pie shell. If you use a store bought pie shell, the filling is almost too much for one deep dish pie shell…the top gets too brown before the filling gets done. I prefer to bake this pie filling in 2 “shallow” pie shells. It's a thinner pie, but turns out perfect.</p>
